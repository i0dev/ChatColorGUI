# ChatColorGUI Plugin!

This plugin allows you to open a gui which you can then select from many nickname options, that are completely 
customizable. You can also choose chat colors!

This is a PLUGIN, and it goes into your `/plugins/` folder on your server. It will not work if It's elsewhere!

### How it works:

You simply run the command /colors, and you are greeted with 2 options, nickname color, and chat color. when you select one, 
you will see a list of all the colors, and when you over over them, you can see if you have permission to use it or not.
All the colors are permission based, example: `chatcolorgui.nickname.yellow`. On the main menu there is a button that you 
can click to remove your nickname or chat color.
